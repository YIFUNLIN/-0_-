    The following changes have been postponed to take effect on April 25, 05:00 UTC

Symbol permission information in Exchange Information responses has moved from field permissions to field permissionSets.
Field permissions will be empty and will be removed in a future release.
Previously, "permissions":["SPOT","MARGIN"] meant that you could place an order on the symbol if your account had SPOT or MARGIN permissions.
The equivalent is "permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"]]. (Note the extra set of square brackets.)
Each array of permissions inside the permissionSets array is called a "permission set".
Symbol permissions can now be more complex.
"permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"],["TRD_GRP_004","TRD_GRP_005"]] means that you may place an order on the symbol if your account has SPOT or MARGIN permissions and TRD_GRP_004 or TRD_GRP_005 permissions.
There may be an arbitrary number of permission sets in a symbol's permissionSets.

    Notice: The changes below are being rolled out gradually, and will take approximately a week to complete.

GET /api/v3/account has a new optional parameter omitZeroBalances, which if enabled hides all zero balances.
The weight of the following requests has been increased from 10 to 25 (This will take effect on April 4, 2024):
GET /api/v3/trades
GET /api/v3/historicalTrades
The POST /api/v3/order/oco endpoint is now deprecated on the REST API. You should use the new POST /api/v3/orderList/oco endpoint instead. Note that this new endpoint uses different parameters.
User Data Stream:

New event listenKeyExpired that will be emitted in the streams if the listenKey expired.
The following will take effect approximately a week after the release date:

There may be an arbitrary number of permission sets in a symbol's permissionSets.
otoAllowed will now appear on GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo, that indicates if One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders are supported on that symbol.
SBE

A new schema 2:0 spot_2_0.xml has been released. The current schema 1:0 spot_1_0.xml will thus be deprecated, and retired from the API in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy.
When using schema 1:0 on REST API or WebSocket API, group "permissions" in message "ExchangeInfoResponse" will always be empty. Upgrade to schema 2:0 to find permission information in group "permissionSets". See General changes above for more details.
Deprecated OCO requests will still be supported by the latest schema.
Note that trying to use schema 2:0 before it is actually released will result in an error.
